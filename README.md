The data alliance, using data for good

## What is Magnitude

Magnitude is an association of those who believe in creating insights with meaning. 

We operate at the confluence of three important groups in our community:

* social organisations and causes
* academic institutions, researchers and students
* corporate firms and industry professionals 

Our ambition is to use data to solve the most important problems in the world around us, and our role is to bring together understanding, expertise and innovation to create self-sustaining solutions driven by data.

## The Order of Magnitude

Our core beliefs:

1. Data at the core
2. Sustainability before scale
3. Impact over investment
4. Open by default
5. Ethically auditable

* Initiate  - we work with social organisations to understand their causes and the challenges they face
* Incubate  - we form diverse teams of academic and corporate talent to discover unique data-first solutions
* Influence - we launch sustainable and connected solutions to support causes with lasting impact
